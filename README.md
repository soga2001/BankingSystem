#Final Project for CSCI2275
This is a Banking System made using C++ with Hash Tables for better and easier accesses to user information. When the program is ran, a menu will appear with 3 options: 1)Login, 2)Create New Account, and 3)Quit. When "Login" is pressed the user has to input their username and password after which, the program will try to find the username and if it is invalid, then it will either ask the user to create a new account or make sure the username or password is correct. When "Create New Account" is pressed, the user will have to input a username and password. After entering the username and password, the program will check to see if there is another user with the same username, if there is not then it will add the new user into the system. When "Quit" is pressed, the program will stop. The program will also utilize deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
